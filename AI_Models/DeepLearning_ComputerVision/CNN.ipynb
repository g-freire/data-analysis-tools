So there are also more patterns that can be captured with large convolutions.For example, it's possible to create a 3x3 convolution that filters for bright pixels with a dark one in the middle. There is no configuration of a 2x2 convolution that would capture this. On the other hand, anything that can be captured by a 2x2 convolution could also be captured by a 3x3 convolution.</p>\n"
