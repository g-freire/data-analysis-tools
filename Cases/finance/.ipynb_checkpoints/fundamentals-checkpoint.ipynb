    "<h5>Profit x Profitability </h5> \n",
    "<p>The key difference here is that profit is an absolute amount while profitability is a relative one</p>\n",
    "<p>Profit measure the absolute number/return between a negotiation, basicly raw output(income/revenue) minus input(cost/expenses). Profitability is the  metric used to determine the scope of a company's profit in relation to the size of the business. Although a company can realize a profit, this does not necessarily mean that the company is profitable. Profitability shows the return on an investment based on its resources in comparison with an alternative investment. </p>\n",

    "<p>ROE(Return on Equity) = (net income) / (shareholders equity). Shows how efficient a company is when using the shareholders’ equity. Net Income(sales minus cost of goods sold, how much revenue exceeds the expenses of an organization) ÷ Shareholder's Equity (company’s total assets minus its debt, liabilities) \n",
    "    ROE of 1.2 means that for every dollar you put in, the company will earn 1.20.  Investors can consider an ROE near the long-term average of the S&P 500 (14%) as an acceptable ratio and anything less than 10% as poor.An extremely high ROE is often due to a small equity account compared to net income, which indicates risk.</p>\n",

Price per share divided by the book value per share.  Low P/B ratios can be indicative of undervalued stocks, and can be useful when conducting a thorough analysis of a stock</p>\n",
    "<p>Price to Earning (P/E) - This ratio compares the current sales price of a company's stock to its per-share earnings. For example, imagine that the price per share is 30 and the stock pays 2 earnings per share: 30 / 2 = 15. P/E also shows how much is returned to investors and not being used in reasearch/development</p>\n",
